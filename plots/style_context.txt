ðŸŽ¨ Matplotlib Style Guide Prompt for AI:
"Generate matplotlib plots using the following visual style:

Color palette:

Deep Blue: #0b3c5d

Mid Blue: #328cc1

Light Blue: #d9eaf7

Deep Red: #6b0f1a

Mid Red: #c94c4c

Light Red: #f9d6d5

Elegant Green (Accent Only): #4c956c

Bar Chart Design:

Use vertical or horizontal bars.

No grey or default bars.

Edge color: white (linewidth=1.5), or matching soft contrast.

Include bar_label for annotations with padding.

Round aesthetics (if supported), padding between bars.

Spines top/right removed, left/bottom faded with alpha 0.3.

Line and Scatter Plots:

Use deep and mid tones of red and blue.

For overlaid plots, apply transparency (alpha=0.5â€“0.7).

Markers: use circles, squares, or triangles with clear contrast (filled with edge).

Use dashed or dotted lines to differentiate overlapping series.

Grid & Layout:

Use subtle gridlines (linestyle='--' or ':', alpha=0.3â€“0.5)

Titles should be bold and descriptive.

Legends must be used if multiple series appear.

Avoid crowded axes; pad ticks slightly (tick_params(pad=6)).

3D Plots (for surface or scatter):

Apply same palette with gradient transitions between deep â†’ light tones.

Prefer minimal axis boxes and add grid where possible.

Overall aesthetic:

Clean, professional, with minimal distractions.

No gray or default matplotlib styles.

Every element should have visual purpose and cohesion."**
